# 🧩 Userscripts Collection

A curated collection of userscripts designed to enhance and customize your web browsing experience.

## What Are Userscripts?

## Development

### Local Testing with Dev Server

A development server is included for testing scripts across devices on your local network before pushing to GitHub.

**Usage:**

```bash
python3 scripts/dev-server.py
```

Then open `http://<your-local-ip>:8080` on any device in your network to see available scripts.

**Features:**
- Adds `[DEV]` prefix to script names (coexists with production scripts)
- Modifies `@namespace` to distinguish from production
- Uses milliseconds since epoch as `@version` (always increases)
- CORS enabled for userscript manager update checks

**Requirements:** Python 3.7+ (standard library only)
